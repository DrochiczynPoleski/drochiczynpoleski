Site "Drohiczyn-Poleski" is dedicated to the history of Drohiczyn and Drohiczyn district.

Here are collected materials ranging from the first mentioning of the city and settlements, churches, forgotten cemeteries, historical sites which are part of the Drohiczyn district or have ever been to this day.

This site is maintained only by me in 2 languages: Russian and English.
