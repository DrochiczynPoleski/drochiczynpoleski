In the past Antopol was part of a large landed property. In the XVIII and XIX centuries, it belonged to the Bystry family, then to the Giedroyts. At the turn of the XVIII-XIX centuries a classicist mansion was built there.

> It was one-storey, with a rectangular base, with a four-pitch roof with mansard windows. The portico was decorated with a triangular top. The mansion was surrounded by a landscaped park. Nowadays, only groups of trees and fragments of the driveway mark the place of the former mansion.

In the second half of the 19th century Duke Romuald Giedroytz married Barbara von Brevern. The huge estate, which in the early twentieth century consisted of eight estates, passed into the ownership of the Russified von Brevern family.

A drawing of the Napoleon Orda estate for 1861-1877 has been preserved.

During the II Rzeczypospolitej (1918 - 1938) the manor house gradually fell into decline, with the arrival of the Communist regime it was finally destroyed. The only thing that remained was a part of the manor park.
