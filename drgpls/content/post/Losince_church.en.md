The Church of the Assumption was built in the cemetery on the outskirts of the village of Losince in 1862 and was attached to the Torokan parish church.

The consecration of the church on June 2, 1870 in the service of four priests was performed by the Antopolskiy district priest Foma Ballandowicz.

At the end of the XIX century in the church there was a locally venerated icon of the Virgin Mary 0.9 meters high and 0.6 meters wide. The icon was painted on a canvas with oil paints, dressed in a silvered riza, with gilded crowns near the heads of the Virgin and the Savior. The Virgin was depicted on the right hand of the Mother of God, blessing with His right hand. From what time and whence this icon appeared in the temple is not known.

On Schubert's maps of 1866-1887 the church was located between 2 cemeteries.

At the time of II Republic of Poland  1919-1938. The church was also active, which is confirmed by the maps. As we can see, the 2nd cemetery from below the church is no longer there.

In July 1944, part of the wall of the Holy Dormition Church was blown up. In the 1960s, services in the church ceased to be performed. The temple was closed. The resumption of services occurred after the consecration of the temple on November 18, 1989 Kobrinskiy district priest Aleksander Lesik. After the resumption of services an independent parish was formed.
