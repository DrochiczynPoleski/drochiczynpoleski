Odryzyn was once part of Drohiczyn district, so it is worth mentioning the local church.

The oldest mention of the church is the metric Uniate books from 1684 to 1801. They are kept in the RGIA. It was a wooden church, consecrated in honor of the Dormition of the Blessed Virgin Mary, standing on the southern shore of the lake.

There is no information about what happened to the church, but in 1783 a new Uniate church was built by landowners Czernecki-Czarny.

There are also mentions of the last Uniate priests of this church until 1837:

> Constanty Zdanowicz, vicar of the church in the village of Odryzyn of Kobryn district. 1832-25.02.1837.

> Jaczinowski Fedor, \* 1752. "From the Minsk province"; ordained by the Pinsk-Turow bishop H. Dashkovich-Gharbatsky in 1784; priest in Odryzyn of Kobryn district. 1832-25.02.1837.

After the Council of Polock in 1839, the church was handed over to the Orthodox Church.

The Grodno archive already has Orthodox metric books from 1843 to 1863. They are also available on the Marmons' website online.

On Rittich's 1864 population maps, the church in Odryzyn is marked on the map.

So on Schubert's maps of 1866-1867, the church is also marked on the map.

On February 25, 1870, the Odryzyn church was consecrated. The parish was headed by priest Innokenty Karnatowski, who graduated from the Lithuanian Theological Seminary. In the period from 1914 to 1923 the parish of Odryzyn, in addition to the village of Odryzyn, included the villages of Glinno and Gorki.

From 05.07.1909 to 09.06.1914. Dubinka Philip Fedorowicz served in the Odryzyn church. He was also a senior teacher of the 2nd railroad school of Pogodino station of the Moscow-Brest railroad.

It is not known whether the church was active during the II Rzeczpospolitej, because the church was not marked on Polish maps.

In 1944 the church burned down.

A new church was built on the place of the old destroyed one. The construction was started in 1993. On May 25, 1999 the church was consecrated in honor of St. Michael the Archangel by His Eminence Stephen, Archbishop of Pinsk and Luninec. In 2006, bells for the temple were purchased, the consecration of which took place on September 19, 2006 by the ruling bishop. In 2015 the temple was renovated.

At the moment the temple is functioning and in perfect condition.
