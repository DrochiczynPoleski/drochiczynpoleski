The list of Christian Catholic settlements from 1726 mentions Perkowicze. It is likely that there was already a Uniate church at that time.

The present stone church was built around 1770 by Zenon Wislouch, a sub-commodore of Brest, owner of Perkowicze. The construction was completed and decorated by his son Victor in 1805. Originally built in the forms of classicism, the church functioned as a Uniate church.

There are also records of priests who served in Perkovichi:

> Buckwheat Andrey\*, 1794\*. Crowned Brest bishop I. -I. Bulgak 1819; priest of the church in Perkowicze, Kobryn district. 1832-25.02.1837. \[575, sheet. 61; 576b sheet. 70 adv. - 71; 695\].

> Nowicki Grzegorz, consecrated by Pinsk-Turow bishop G. Daszkowicz-Gorbacki on 14.04.1779; the priest of the church in Perkowicze, Pinsk district. 1795. Sons: Tadevush, Anton, Hyacinth-Andrei. \[138, sheet, 10-13\].

The remains of Bishop Terletski, which had previously rested in an old wooden crypt on the Wislouch estate, were transferred to the new church. Zenon Wislouch and Felix Wislouch and their wives were also buried in the crypt in 1805.

This is confirmed by the record of 1899, in the description of parishes and churches of Grodno province. It is also worth noting that the bell tower had a bell cast in 1601.

There are also Uniate metrics preserved from 1770 to 1801 RGIA.

Also on the Marmons site are Uniate church metrics from 1822 to 1853.

After the ban of the Unia, the church was taken over by the Orthodox Church.
In 1882 the parishioners donated 125 rubles. These funds were used to repair the church, the bell tower and the fence.

During the period of II Rzeczypospolitej, the church is mentioned on the maps of 1919-1939.

The church remained active until 1961, then fertilizers were stored in it, which began to destroy the brick walls of the temple. Then the church was destroyed by the Bolsheviks, leaving only the walls in place of the ancient temple. The church was repaired in 1990 by local parishioners by their own efforts. The renovated church was consecrated by His Eminence Konstantin, Archbishop of Brest and Kobryn on November 24, 1990.
