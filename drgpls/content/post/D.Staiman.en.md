It's also worth noting that at the age of 63, David Steinman became interested in poetry. Many people wrote to him saying that his bridges represented poetry. This inspired him to start writing. His love of building bridges was reflected in his work, which can be seen in the titles of two of his poems: “The Bridge” and ‘I Built a Bridge’. He was greatly recognized for his poetry; many of his poems were published in various newspapers and magazines, as well as in the book I Built a Bridge and Other Poems, published in 1955. Steinman became a leader of many poetry groups, including the president of the [Wisconsin Poetry] Foundation (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wisconsin_Poetry_Foundation&action=edit&redlink=1) and the director. [The poetry institute in New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Poetry_Institute_in_New_York&action=edit&redlink=1) .
