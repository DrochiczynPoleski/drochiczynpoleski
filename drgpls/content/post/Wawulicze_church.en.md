At the moment there is no exact information whether the church was built during the Uniate period or as an Orthodox church. The first official mention of the church in Wawulicze can be dated back to 1631. At that time, a Uniate priest who served in Wawulicze is mentioned.

The current church was built in 1737 of wood as a Uniate church, which is confirmed by the Grodno Orthodox Church Calendar of 1899. Unfortunately, there is no information about what happened to the old church and whether a new one was built in its place.

According to others in 1875:

In 1878 it was thoroughly repaired and acquired its present form: rectangular in shape with a pentagonal altar apse, gable roof and onion dome. Near the church there is a two-story wooden building, which combines a boiler house, a bell tower and a parish library.

On Schubert's maps of 1866-1887, the church is shown on the maps.

In 1885 a ministerial public school was opened at the church, where peasant children of both sexes were educated. In 1911 the peasants who returned from America donated 435 rubles to the church for the painting of the altar and iconostasis, which was done by the artist M. Birev.
