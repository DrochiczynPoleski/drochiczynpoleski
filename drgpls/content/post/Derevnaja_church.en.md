It is known that since the 17th century Derevnaya was a stopping place for Jesuits for missionary work. A church was built here, which had an image of “Mother of God”.

The list of Christian Catholic settlements from 1726 mentions Derewnia (Derevnia). It is now called Derewnia.

Since 1744 years, Derevnaya has been a branch church of the Braszewicze parish. It is included in the deanery of Szereszewski, Lutsk parish.

There is also a list of missionaries of those times in Derevnaya:

1. 1750-1752 – Michał Obrębski
2. 1752-1753 – Antoni Sztemberg
3. 1754 – Stanisław Dzierżyński
4. 1754-1755 – Antoni Sztemberg
5. 1757-1760 – Nepomucen Kozłowski

It is not known what became of the church, but in 1745 a Greek Catholic church was built in Derevnaya.

In 1773 the area and the property were given to the state.

Thus there is a mention of a Greek-Catholic clergyman in this church:

> Dyshkovskiy Pavel, * 1785. Married to the Braski Episcopalian I.-I. Bulgakam 1808; saint in the v. Derevnaya, Kobryn pub. 1832 - 25.02.1837.

Also in RGIA there are Greek-Catholic metric records from our church. But please pay attention to 1 screen. As it does not indicate Kobrin district. There is a possibility that it is Derevnaya from Slonim.

The Marmons also have Greek Catholic metric books for 1824 on their website.

After the Council of Polotsk in 1839, the church was handed over to the Orthodox.

In 1864 and 1866, the church was active and marked on maps.

During the II Rzeczpospolitej the church was active, it was also marked on maps.

![1918-1938-1_53658834692_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/a6a45956-98bd-4276-8b78-91cde7f9e302)

After the partition of the II Rzeczpospolitej, the change of power to communist, and the beginning of World War II. The church fell into disrepair, and considering that the post-war policy of the USSR was against religion, in 1967 the church was bulldozed to the ground and the remaining ruins were set on fire.

The plan of the church and its photo before its destruction by the authorities have been preserved.

On the initiative of local residents, as well as practically for their donations in 2012 began work on the restoration of the temple. The rite of consecration was performed on the day of commemoration of St. Tihon and the Council of Holy Fathers of the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church of 1917-1918. The new temple was opened in 2018.
