The record of 27 Volhynian Infantry Division (27 Volhynian Infantry Division) from 1944-1945 confirms that the village of Gorice already existed before the arrival of the USSR on the territory of western Belarus.

> Gdy minęliśmy miejscowość Kortelisy, nasz batalion został ostrzelany ogniem od czoła. Ruszyliśmy natychmiast do kontrataku wspierani przez batalion „Hrubego”. Nieprzyjaciel się wycofał, a my dotarliśmy do wsi Jaźwiniec, gdzie się zatrzymaliśmy. W sąsiedniej wsi Horyce już stało zgrupowanie „Gardy”, przygotowujące się do marszu za linię frontu na Prypeci.

> When we passed the settlement of Kortelisy, our battalion was shelled. We immediately moved to counterattack with the support of the Hruby battalion. The enemy retreated and we reached the village of Yazvinets, where we stopped. In the neighboring village of Horyce, the “Garda” group was already standing, preparing for the March behind the front line at Pripyat.

With the advent of Soviet power in 1939, all the farms were liquidated and the inhabitants moved to the village of Horyce.

From July 1944 to May 1945 most of the male population was drafted into the army, many were killed and wounded. No collaborators with the Nazis were observed. However, after the war several families took part in the independence movement (Banderites), some of them were sentenced to 10-15 years in camps.

In the post-war period life on the farm remained hard, people were forced to work on collective farms. Pensions began to be granted only in the 1960s, and their size was inferior to that of the urban population. In the 60s the average pension amounted to 12 rubles, in the 70s - 25 rubles, in the 80s - 33 rubles.

At present only one farmstead is inhabited. The last farmsteads were liquidated in the 70s-80s of the XX century. There was no electricity in the farmsteads, the inhabitants used candles and kerosene lamps. This was one of the main reasons for moving to the village.
