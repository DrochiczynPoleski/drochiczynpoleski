The church in Subboty (formerly called Malaya Torokan) was built in 1797 by Basilian monks from the Tarakan monastery (now v. Imenin).

The description of the date of construction is available in “Descriptions of churches and parishes. Grodno Orthodox Church Calendar. Volume 1.” It is worth noting that in 1899 there were already 2 churches attached to this church from Imenin and Losinets. The first one was probably assigned because of the decline of the Basilian monastery after the Polotsk cathedral.

After the Council of Polotsk this church passed to the Orthodox. By decree No. 14711 of the Holy Synod of 1897 on December 23, 1897 the Saturday parish church of the Nativity of the Mother of God was renamed from Tarakanska.

At the time of II Rzeczypospolitej 1919-1939 the church was active. This is confirmed by its marking on maps and photos of its current renovation.

Also in the book “Collection of Historical and Cultural Ponents. Brest region” there is a description of the church.

At present the church is in good condition and active. Unfortunately there are no metric books for this church, and no records of Uniate ministers as well as Orthodox ministers before 1918.
