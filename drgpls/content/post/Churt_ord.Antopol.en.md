A pre-war guidebook to Polesie mentions that in 1718 the resident Antonina Zamoyska founded a Uniate Basilian monastery here.

Therefore, the earliest document can be considered to be the metric Uniate books from 1719 to 1799, which are currently in RGIA.

In 1807 the monastery Holy Trinity Church burned down. Only the icon of the Virgin Mary with the Infant in her arms was saved. The male monastery of the Basilian order was abolished in 1834.

Uniate/Orthodox metrics from 1820 to 1846 can be found on the Marmon website.

Also worth mentioning is an icon that was rescued from the fire of an old Uniate church, its inventory is available in “Descriptions of Churches and Parishes. Grodno Orthodox Church Calendar.” It should be separately noted that there are drawn monograms in the middle with a ruby of the Polish King Stanislaw August. It is also mentioned that the owner of those places at that time was Princess Elizabeth Giedrojc.

There is also a list of Uniate priests who served in Antopol.

Studied at the Vilnius Main Theological Seminary \[09.06.1820-07.01.1842\], very good behavior, master of theology in 1824; ordained by the auxiliary bishop of Orsha, A. Galauney, in 1822; the priest of the church in the city of Antopol, Kobryn district. 1836-25.02.1837; Dračinsk dean of the 1830s; Assessor of the Lithuanian Spiritual Consistory in 1836.

The current Orthodox church was built from scratch in 1857 or earlier (it may well have been rebuilt for Orthodoxy, as there are mentions of Uniate priests after 1830), by the local landowner Count Kosmoja Ozharovski, on the site of the old Uniate church and monastery.

On Rittich's maps of 1864, Antopolska church is marked on the map and had the status of Blagochenie.

On Schubert's 1866 maps, the church is also labeled.

![1866-2_53658330475_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/a224f3b5-4ef7-42cf-acb6-0c75e24ae664)

Next to the church there is a bell tower, built in 1866, two-tiered, frame, covered with a hipped roof.

In 1872, a cemetery church was built in Antopol, which was attached to the Resurrection church there. Nowadays it is bricked up and by mistake the year 1857 is written there.

![1872_53658219089_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/40405893-3b72-406f-bb9c-219a570ffe18)

In 1875, the parish of the Resurrection Church was completed. Due to the overhaul of the church it was not possible to hold services inside the church. The construction was initiated by Archpriest Fiodor Gordacewicz.

Orthodox metric books for the years 1867 - 1872. They are in the Grodno archive.

There is a photograph of the church taken in 1916.

![1916_53658089853_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/bc6ed8f2-8106-4849-baba-644e221ca7da)

During the II Polish Republic Poslka (1918-1938) the church was active, it was also marked on Polish maps.

The church is currently active and in good condition.

![2020-1_53658332620_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/16ad4742-98de-4a8c-add7-0b6ee5d9848e)

It is worth noting that the memorial column of the Constitution of May 3, 1791 has been preserved on the territory of the church. At the moment the texts on the column have been erased, so it is impossible to read anything on it.
