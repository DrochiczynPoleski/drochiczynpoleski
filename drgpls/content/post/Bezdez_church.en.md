Bezdež is mentioned in the 15th century as "Bezdež Parish", as part of the Zdítov Parish. In 1409 Grand Duke Witowt gave Bezdeż parish to the Church of the Mother of God in Troki. In 1495 Bezdeż is mentioned in the gift harmony of the Minsk princess Maria Semyonova Aleksandrovna (widow of Prince Simeon Alelkovich) and her son Prince Vasily Semeonovich to the Pinsk viceroy Furs Ivanovich. In documents from 1517 to the 18th century, the Bezdež estate, which was owned by the canons of the church in Troki, its borders and lands previously owned by the Pinsk princes, are mentioned. In 1561-66 Bezdež received town rights. In 1622 the Bezdež church was mentioned. Until 1744 a Roman Catholic parish was established.

In August-September 1771, near Bezdež there was a heavy battle between the Bar confederates under the command of Hetman M.K. Oginsky and detachments of Russian troops of A.A. Albishav.

In the "Historical Lithuanian Archives" there are metric books from 1700 to 1801. So at that time there was already a functioning church there.

In the list of Christian Catholic settlements of 1726 the parish of Bezdzeż is mentioned. The center of the parish was Bezdzeż, so there was already an active church there at that time.

The current Holy Trinity Church was built in 1784 on the foundations of a 17th century Uniate church, which burned down. According to other data it was built in 1818 on the place of the deserted church. And it was also Uniate. This is confirmed by the records of Uniate priests who served in this church until 1839:
