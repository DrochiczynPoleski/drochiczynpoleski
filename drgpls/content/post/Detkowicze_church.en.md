The parish of Detkovichi was founded and the church was built of wood by the landowner Pavel Bukhovetsky, a clerk of the Brest voivodeship, in 1740. The church, built at the time of the Unia, was adapted to the Uniate worship.
It is known that the church was repaired in the 20s of the XIX century.

But it is worth mentioning that Detkovichi is mentioned in the “List of Christian Catholic settlements in 1726”

Description of the church:

> Consists of rectangular in plan main and altar log cabins, covered with a common roof with triangular overhangs at the junction of log cabins and a small faceted head above the main facade. Along the longitudinal axis, a low sacristy with a single-sloped roof is attached to the altar block, which gives the church a stepped outline. The walls are horizontally paneled and finished with a developed profiled cornice. The main facade is decorated with four blades of different heights, finished with a shield with a pediment above it and a rhombic window in the center. The two-tiered, four-tiered belfry-gate is located separately on the axis of the church. The designs of the upper through tier of the belfry also have a pattern in the form of rhombuses.

In RGIA there are metric books of the church from 1742 to 1801.

In the 1840s of the 19th century, during the rebuilding of this church into an Orthodox church, its internal appearance was changed.

On Rittich's maps of 1864, Detkovichi with the church is marked.

Already on Schubert's maps of 1866, there are 2 churches in Detkovichi, one is our church, the other is a church, which will be described later.

In the 1899 book “Descriptions of churches and parishes. Grodno Orthodox Church Calendar. Volume 1.” There is a description of the church.

![189911_53659701631_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/4b8ab5d3-e0fb-4a8e-bdeb-1e7272cb5f4c)

In 1884, priest Konstantin Zhukovich was appointed rector of this church, who set himself the task of renovating and bringing the temple of God into proper shape. The church was rebuilt in 1884 according to the project of engineer A. Remer. Repair work began in the first days of May and by October 15 it was finished.
On October 22, 1888, the consecration of the temple was performed by the dean of the church, priest John Ogiewicz with 6 priests and a deacon.

During the II Rzeczypospolitej 1919-1939 the church was active, also marked on maps of that time.

![1919-1939-2_53659928928_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/b197655d-6841-4cca-8c94-dc53483a82df)

Nowadays the Holy Protection Church looks like this: two rectangular log cabins of the main volume and the apse are covered with a common gable roof with valleys above the apse and with sliders in the places where the log cabins are connected. Above the main facade the roof is crowned with an octagonal turret with an onion chapter. The small volume of the narthex is covered with a gable roof. A lower vestry volume is attached to the apse end. The side facades are horizontally boarded, partitioned with troughs and rectangular window openings, finished with a developed cornice. The interior space of the church is covered with a flat ceiling, above the entrance there are choirs. In front of the church is a brama-bell - a two-tiered tetrahedral volume with a hipped roof. The first tier is vertically sheathed with boards with lapboards, the second tier is open, reinforced with frame posts. The church is a monument of folk wooden architecture.
