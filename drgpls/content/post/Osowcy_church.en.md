In 1836 the iconostasis was built. In the church there was a revered icon of the Mother of God "Sorrowful", which was considered a miracle-working "painting expressive", painted on canvas with oil paints. In 1814 the icon was covered with a silver riza with gilded crowns over the countenances and decorated with "brilliant" stones. It is believed that the icon was originally located in the Belinskaya church, which was organized in the manor of Orzeszko in 1785 (in 1785 the icon was transferred to Osovtsy). The icon was in the high place, but in the 1880s the Belinska church was destroyed due to dilapidation and the icon was moved to the Osovetska church. The icon was placed on the left choir at the wall in a gilded casket, which was arranged by the diligence of donors in 1893. The icon was celebrated on August 15 (on the Dormition) and many people from the surrounding villages, including Catholics, gathered for this pilgrimage.
