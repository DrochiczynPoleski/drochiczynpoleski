Unfortunately, the exact date of construction of the church in Liachowiczy has not been found yet. Approximately old wooden church was built at the end of the XVIII century.

You can read about it in “In the list of Christian Catholic settlements in 1726”

But the oldest document about the existence of the church can be considered the preserved Uniate metric books in RGIA from 1776 to 1801.

Further, the Marmon site also has metrics for Liachowiczy for 1823.

There is a list of Uniate clergy who served in the church:

> Lichaczewski (Lichaczewicz) Nicholas, * 1787. “From the Podlachia Province of the Polish Republic”; baptized by the Braski Episcopal Bishop I.-I. Bulgakam 1813; saint of the tsar in. Liachowiczy Kobrynskag pav. 1832 - 25.02.1837. \[575, arc. 69; 576, arc. 74 adv.-75; 695]

> Fiodor Liszniewicz, * 1799. Blessed by the Brescian episkapa-surfagan L.-L. Jaworowski 1824; saint of the tsar in. Liachowiczy Kobrynská pav. 1836 - 25.02.1837. \[576, arc. 70 adv. - 71; 695].

Since 1839 the church was handed over to the Orthodox.

It is also worth mentioning the Grodno archive, which has documents on the Liachowiczy from 1843 to 1866.

The church is labeled on the 1864 maps.

![1864-2_53660005936_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/20235fee-664a-496e-9ca1-312b419805e8)

But the church is also noted on the 1866 - 69 maps.

![1866-1_53660006026_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/9c788309-48ce-4338-b740-021cabb3856f)

It was renewed in 1873, and burned in 1881. In “Descriptions of churches and parishes. Grodno Orthodox Church Calendar. Volume 1” mentions that in 1884 a wooden Orthodox church was built by the efforts of the parishioners and a government grant during the rectorship of priest Nikolai Druzilowski. In 1861 a parochial school was opened.

It is worth noting, if we compare the location of the churches with today's maps, we can see that the church was built on the site of an old church (or very close to that site).

![2020_53659145262_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/596a65e9-e4a1-47b2-9436-8595c9073b47)

At the time of Second Republic of Poland 1919 - 1938 the church was an active Orthodox church, as the maps confirm. But it was marked as a Catholic parish.

![1919-1939_53659145362_o](https://github.com/escfrpls/drochiczynpoleski/assets/125834172/50f7f3f8-f72b-4c5f-9b97-4f154e28145a)

There is also a list of Orthodox clergy who served after the Polotsk Cathedral in 1839. It is worth noting that the priest Nikolai Lichaczewski converted from Unia to Orthodoxy.

The church was not closed under Soviet rule. In 1944 and 1980s the church was slightly renovated.

At the moment the church is active and in good condition.
