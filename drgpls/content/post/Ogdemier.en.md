The village of Ogdemier was first mentioned in 1630 under the name "Idemer," and in 1770 it was referred to as "Gdemer." On a map from 1750, the road passing through the village was designated as a main route. The village was advantageously located and attracted the attention of the nobility.

In 1867, it was part of the Worocewicze wolost in the Kobrin district of the Grodno Governorate. At that time, the area recorded 369 "souls," which also included people living in the estates of Ogdemier (Kurowska), Ostrowki (Rudolf Tarnowski), Podwincze (Anton Dubienecki), Guta (Ivan Dubienecki), Kerenuwok (Anton Zalewski), Gusowka (Mrs. Krestnikowa), and Ogdemier (Mr. Zabolocki). In 1860, there were manorial estates in this region, known as Ogdemier-1 and Ogdemier-2, owned by Mr. Zablodsky and Mrs. Kurovskaya. Given that they owned an equal number of souls, they were likely relatives who had inherited and divided the land.

In 1890, the rural community had 687 desyatinas of land, of which 370 were arable. The estates of Ostrowki, Ogdemier, and the Zawadycze tract, belonging to A. Malkowski, occupied 583 desyatinas, with 437 being arable. Additionally, near Ogdemier, 128 desyatinas were owned by other individuals, of which 85 were unusable.

In 1905, the village had a population of 573 and a school.

During World War I, when the district was occupied by German forces, the village's population decreased significantly, with many residents becoming refugees. Those with land in the village returned after the war but faced difficulties in farming. Other former residents (287 people, or half the pre-war population) did not return, having settled on more fertile lands in the Kaluga and Woronez Governorates.

From 1921 to 1939, during the time of the "II Polish Republic," the village was part of the Worocewicze Gmina in the Drochiczyn district of Polesie Voivodeship.

In 1921, the village had 79 households (31 of which were uninhabited as their owners had not returned from being WWI refugees) and 286 inhabitants, of whom 244 were Orthodox, 36 Catholic, and 6 Jewish. Some residents appealed to the authorities for a Ukrainian school, but this request was unsuccessful, and the school was not opened. Instead, there was a Polish school with 55 students.

Starting from 04.12.1939, with the arrival of Soviet, Ogdemier was in Drohiczyn District, Pinsk Oblast, BSSR.

As of 12.10.1940, it became the center of a rural council in Drohiczyn District, Pinsk Oblast. The village had 131 households and 1,007 residents, a primary school, and a peat factory. The rural council consisted of 340 households with 2,110 residents.

During World War II, 34 residents of the village perished, and 17 did not return from the front.

In 1949, a collective farm named after Czkalov (led by M.M. Szpak) was established. In 1954, the Ogdemier rural council was abolished, and from 08.01.1954, Ogdemier became part of Brest Region, and since 1959, the village was part of the Gutowsky rural council, with 525 residents in 1959, 448 in 1970, and 135 households and 254 residents in 1995.

A cemetery from World War I is preserved in the village.
