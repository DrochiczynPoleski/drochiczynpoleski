There are no precise data on the construction or already functioning church before the Union of Brest. The first official mention at this time can be considered in the list of Christian Catholic settlements of 1726, where Holowczyce is mentioned.

In the description of “Descriptions of churches and parishes. Grodno Orthodox Church Calendar. Volume 1”, it is mentioned that the current church was built by the owner of the Holowczyce estate Kutnikov and parishioners in 1766 on the place of the old church, which burned down. It was built as a Uniate church. During the construction materials of the old Torokan church were used.

The RGIA archive preserved Uniate metric books from 1767 to 1801.

The Marmons site also has Uniate metrics for 1823.

There are also records of Uniate priests who performed services in Golovchitsy:

> Druzhilovsky Yan, Druzhilovsky Ivan, priest of the church in the village of Heads of Kobryn district. 1832. \[575, sheet. 63\]

> Druzhilovsky Ludvik son of Yan, Druzhilovsky Ludwig Ivanov, \* 1805. Consecrated by the Brest bishop-suffragan L.-L. Yavarovskyi 1832; the priest of the church in Heads of Kobryn district. 1836 - 25.02.1837. \[576, sheet. 67 Adv. - 68; 695\]

After the Polotsk Cathedral the church was handed over to the Orthodox. The National Historical Archives of Belarus in Hrodna keeps the archives of the church for 1835-1874, 1881-1882, 1929.

An Orthodox parish in Holowczyce is marked on Rittich's maps for 1864.

1866 and on Schubert's maps, it is also available.

In 1875 the church was renovated. During the renovation a new iconostasis and a new floor were installed.

There is a photo of the church at the beginning of the XX century.

But for unknown reasons the church was lost in the early 20th century. Then in the village of Povit, Kobrin district, the church was dismantled and the material from the church was taken to the village of Holowczyce to rebuild the church. It was built with a “cross” and operated until 1942.

During the II Rzeczpospolita the church was active, it was also marked on Polish maps of 1919 - 1939.

From the memories of old residents, in 1942 on Good Friday of Holy Week in the afternoon, before the removal of the Shroud, there was a fire. From the church utensils managed to save the hoops and the coffin of the Shroud. After the fire a few services were held on the ashes, and then the parishioners began to go to the church in the village of Tolkovo. By permission of the German authorities, the church was soon rebuilt from the dismantled and transported Jewish synagogue from Antopol. Divine services began to be held already in 1943 on Easter.
In 1948 the priest's family was repressed and taken to Siberia, and the priest was shot.
The church was closed. The church building was used as a warehouse, and in 1952 the Executive Committee decided to transfer the church building to the village club.
In September 1989 the building was returned to the believers. In a short period of time by the efforts of the parishioners the church was restored.
