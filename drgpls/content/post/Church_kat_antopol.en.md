The Catholic Chapel (Bel. kaplica) was built in Antopol in 1838. It was attached to the Gorodets parish church.

In the description of the 1909 book. "Guide to Lithuania and Belarus" N. Rouba, mentions a chapel in Antopol, in Grodno province.

Given that Cappela belonged to the Gorodecka paraphy, Kobrin-Rome deanery, it is worth looking at the surviving metric books for the area on the Marmon site from 1706 to 1866.

On the Schubert and Rittich maps of 1866 - 1890, Cappella was not marked on the map.

At the time of II Rzeczypospolitej 1918 - 1939), in the book "Grzegorz Rąkowski; Smak Kresów; Czar Polesia, Rewasz 2001", the church in Antopol is already mentioned.

> The Catholic Church of St. Andrzej Boboli was founded (in our case reconstructed from a chapel) in 1938. The funds for the construction were obtained from a fundraiser organized by Maria Rodziewiczowna among local landowners. At the request of the writer, the Jesuit provincial gave the new church a relic of the patron saint of Polesie - St. Andrew Boboli. Bishop Kazimir Bukraba of Pinsk consecrated the church. In 1939, with the arrival of Soviet power, the church was closed. It was built in the style of constructivism, using the highest geometric forms and an image that refuses to be decorated. It is a box-like structure on a rectangular plane, devoid of details, with a flat facade, above which rises a quadrangular village covered with a flat roof.

The kappela was also marked on Polish maps of the time.

After the war the church fell into disrepair, now it houses the fire station of the town of Antopol.
