In the newspaper “Echo”, 1931, Lodz, there is an entry about a resident of the village of Tolkowo, a 16 year old shepherd Mikołaj Rapienczuk from the village of Tolkowo. He ruined the railroad for fun. The train ran over and got stuck on an iron hook sticking out of the rails. None of the passengers were injured.
