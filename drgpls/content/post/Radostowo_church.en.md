Unfortunately, there is no mention of the construction of the church in Radostowo, whether it was built before the Union of Brest is also unknown.

But since the time of the Union in 1569 there are already references to the church in Radostowo as a Uniate church.

> Taranowicz Piotr, Administrator of the church in the town of Radostowo, Ratna district. KP 22.01.1771. \[5, sheet. 182 adv., 188 adv\].

> Borkowski Alexander, 1756\*. Ordained by Bishop M. Ryl of Kholm and Belz in 1783; Administrator of the church in Radostowo, Ratna district. KP 14.01.1793. Married; 2 sons, a daughter on 14.01.1793. \[7, sheet. 46 adv., 49\].

The RGIA archive also has metric Uniate books for Radostovo from 1790 to 1797.

After 1839, all Uniate churches were handed over to the Orthodox. In the course of time the Uniate church was destroyed, unfortunately there is no information about the reason.

In 1862 an Orthodox church was built in place of the Uniate church. The church was built of wood on a stone foundation in the form of an equilateral oblong cross. A wooden bell tower with three bells was built next to the church.

Rittich's 1864 maps show an Orthodox parish in Radostowo (Radistaw). It belonged to the Wolyn province.

Schubert's maps of 1866-67, also show this Orthodox church.

In the time of II Rzeczpospolita (1919-1939). The church is also marked on maps (Radostów).

In 1962 the Holy Protection Church was closed. Divine services were not performed in it. All the church utensils were taken to the Nativity Church in the village of Liachowicze. For some time the building of the Church of the Intercession was used as a warehouse for storing grain. By the end of the XX century the church became dilapidated and decayed, there was a need for repair work. Local residents repaired the church with their own strength and means. During the reconstruction the shape of the building was changed. June 10, 1989, the repaired church was consecrated Kobrynskiy district priest Alexander Lesik.

At the moment it is a functioning church.
