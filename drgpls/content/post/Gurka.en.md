During the II Rzeczpospolita, the village of Górka still existed, which is confirmed by maps.

On Polish maps before 1919, the village is abolished under the name of Górka.

The situation with the parishes was as follows:

- The Orthodox went to the Volovelsky Orthodox Parish of the Great Martyr George the Victorious;
- The Catholic part of the population went to the Popinsky Catholic Parish of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

After the communist power came to the territory of western Belarus, the name remained the same, and on July 10, 1940, the first collective farms were formed in the villages of Gurka and Osovtsy.

According to information received from the chairman of the village executive committee, Gurka was last mentioned as a separate village in 1979.
