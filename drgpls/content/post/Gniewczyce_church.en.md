The earliest mention of the church in Gniewczyce can be considered the book “Mironowicz A.: The Turaŭ-Pinsk bishopric in the 11th-16th centuries. Trans Humana, 2011.” Where in the Turow-Pińsk Biskupstvo the paraphyses in the XI-XVI century are described, the Gniewicz paraphy is also mentioned.

The church after the signing of the Unia was converted to Greek Catholicism, which is confirmed by the preserved metric Uniate books in RGIA for 1800-1801.
