BUND (General Jewish Workers Union in Lithuania, Poland and Russia) (Yiddish בונד Bund - "union", the full name is אַלגעמיינער ייִדישער אַרבעטערסבונד אין ליטע, פּוילן און רוסלאַנד (Algemeiner Jiddischer Arbeter Bund in Lite, Poiln un Russland) was a Jewish socialist party active in Eastern Europe from the 1990s to the 1940s. The Bund considered itself the sole representative of the interests of the Jewish working class, which was quite numerous in these lands.

The Jewish population actively participated in the political life of Drohiczynshchyna. The slow modernization of the town reduced the influence of Orthodox circles on public life. Some Jews supported the ideas of Zionism, which was represented in the town by various organizations. The youth slowly became involved in the revolutionary and labor movement. In 1903, with the support of the Central Committee, a local Bund organization was established in Pinsk. Its leaders were the son of a local doctor, Mordechai Weissman, and W. Polak. Secret meetings of the Bund members took place in the woods or in a building near the old cemetery. The first major victory of the Bund was the strike of the workers of the Reuwena Beita shoe factory, which refused to accept the workers' demands. Arełe Rosenzweig, who was a member of the Bund party, forced the businessman to accept the workers' conditions.

During the 1905-1907 revolution, peasants' and workers' unrest engulfed the villages and towns of Zagorodie. The Bund party was active among the workers. More than twenty people of artisans from Drohiczyn and railroad workers were arrested.
