In the past Antopol was part of a large land property. In the 18th and 19th centuries it belonged to the Bystrych family, then to the Giedrojci family. At the turn of the XVIII-XIX centuries, a classicist mansion was built here.

> It was one-storied, with a rectangular base, with a four-pitched roof with mansard windows. The portico was decorated with a triangular top. The mansion was surrounded by a landscaped park. At present, only groups of trees and fragments of an access alley mark the site of the former cloister.

In the second half of the 19th century, Duke Romuald Giedroyc married Barbara von Brevern. The huge estate, which at the beginning of the 20th century consisted of eight estates, was taken over by the russified von Brevern family.

A drawing of the Napoleon Orde estate from 1861-1877 has been preserved.

During the II Rzeczypospolitej (1918 - 1938) the manor gradually fell into decay, and with the arrival of the communist authorities it was finally destroyed. The only thing that remains is a part of the homestead park.
