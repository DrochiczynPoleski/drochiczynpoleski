Entin Shlomo was born in 1915 in Drohiczyn. He was a Zionist activist and participant in the resistance movement.

Because of the moving war front of World War 2, his family moved to Yekaterinoslav (now Dnepropetrovsk). In 1922, the Entin family moved to Pinsk, where Shloma's father had a haberdashery store. Shlomo graduated from the Tarbut school and joined the Zionist movement. During the Holocaust, he was in Vilnius. He belonged to those who first thought of armed resistance to the Nazis. During the Yom Kippur campaign in 1941, when almost 4,000 people were killed. Jews from Vilnius, Entin, standing on Shavelska Street, distracted Lithuanian policemen to bring the Jews to the place of execution. In this way he saved the lives of several ghetto prisoners. At the end of 1941, he handed over to the Jewish underground in Warsaw the first reports of Jewish casualties in Vilnius. He asked for money and weapons for future militants. Back in Vilnius, Entin continued his activities underground. In April 1942, during one of his missions, Entin was arrested on his way from Bialystok to Warsaw. The Germans, who already knew about the forged documents of the “resistance movement”, carefully checked his documents and found that they were indeed forged. Together with his friends, Sara and Heshka Zilber, Shlomo was imprisoned in Warsaw. In July 1942, they were murdered.
