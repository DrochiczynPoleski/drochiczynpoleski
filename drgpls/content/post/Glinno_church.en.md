The first mention of the church in Glinno can be attributed to 1660. The then Orthodox church was destroyed by the Polish army. This record is mentioned in Wlodimir Leontiuk's book “Slovnik Berestiyschyny”.

It is not known in what year and by whom the old Orthodox church was built or restored. In the following records this church is mentioned as a Uniate church. This is confirmed by a list of Greek Catholic clergymen in Glinno:

- Zdanowicz Antoni, presented by the under-chaser of the Ukrainian National League, Yavchym-Karal Potocki; ordained by the Pinsk-Tura bishop Yu. Bulgak in 1763; priest of the church in Glinna of Pinsk district. 1763-17.01.1777.
- Koruński Bazyli, administrator of the church in the village. Glinna of Pinsk district. 21.02.1787
- Zhdanovich Gavriil Antonov, \* 1765, † 1803. Priest in the village. Glinna Pinsky (after Mozyrsky) district. 1795 - 1803; the church was transferred to the Orthodox department in 1795; uncle Teodor Zdanovich.
- Konczewski Grzegorz, \* 1763; The priest of the church in Glinna Pinsky (after Kobrynsky) district. 1799 (former). Wife Catherine, \* 1769; son John, \* 1796.

**It should be noted that in 1795 the church was temporarily transferred to the orthodox department.

There is also no information about what became of the Uniate church, but in 1773 Anthony Kulikovsky built (or restored) the church in Glinno.

After the Council of Polotsk, the church was handed over to the Orthodox. During the Russian Empire, the church was active, which is confirmed by the maps of those times by Schubert and Rittich.

At present there is no church in Glinno, unfortunately there is no information about the fate of the church after World War 2, who destroyed it and when. Perhaps the article, it will be possible in the future to supplement after a request to the bishop's office in Ivanovo district.
