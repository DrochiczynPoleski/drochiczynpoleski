When and by whom the church in Ziolowo was built is not mentioned at the moment. But according to the found documents it can be traced that the first mention is related to Catholicism.

In the list of Christian Catholic settlements of 1726 Ziolowo is mentioned. It is likely that it was already a Uniate church at that time.

Constitutiones Synodales Diaecesis Luceoriensis & Brestensis ab Illustrissimo Excellentissimo & Reverendissimo Domino”, D. Stefano Boguslao a Rupniew in Januszowice Rupniewski; Anno Domini 1726.

You can also find the "Inventory of the parish of the population of Ziolowo" for 1824 on the Marmon site. Here is a [link](https://www.familysearch.org/search/film/004222755?cat=1124083) to the document, page 623.

Further in Zelovo there is mentioned a wooden Holy Trinity Orthodox church in 1842.
At the moment it is not known whether it was built on the site of the Uniate church and what became of it.
It was built at the expense of Colonel Vasily Danilovich Mandrykin. Who was buried on the territory of the church.
Fifteen steps away from him erected a bell tower, through which led the road to the church. The church was built in the form of a cross. Fifteen steps away from the central entrance they erected a two-tiered bell tower with an inner passage. The parishioner, before entering the shrine, had to pass through this passage.

In the book "Descriptions of churches and parishes. Grodno Orthodox Church Calendar. Volume 1" there is a mention of the church, approximate year of record 1867:

On June 20, 2005 the Ziolowo church burned down. According to media reports, the firemen explained the phenomenon as follows: "A banal violation of fire safety rules in the use of electrical appliances. After the service they wanted to wash candlesticks, heated water on the electric stove, and forgot to turn it off. And the fact that it burned quickly, so it was wooden, in addition to the holiday just painted. That's why the fire was good.
