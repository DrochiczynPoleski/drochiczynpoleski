The current Church of the Intercession in the village of Chomsk was built in 1992. It was consecrated on February 25, 1993.
The first mention of the church in Hutowo can be attributed to the time when there was a Uniate church in the area.

In RGIA there are metric Uniate books on Hutowo, unfortunately the years of collected information are not described.

In 1892 an Orthodox church was built in Hutowo. There is no information about whether the church was built on the place of the old church and why the old church is gone.

The church is mentioned in the “Description of churches and parishes. Grodno Orthodox Church Calendar. Volume 1”

During the II Republic of Poland, until 1939 the church was active.

But after the partition of Poland, World War II, and the arrival of communist rule, the church fell into disrepair. At the beginning of 1963, the church was burned down by the communists, and in its place was built “House of Culture”.

The old church remains only in a single photograph taken by Archpriest Michael Sazanovich, who served for many years in the neighboring parish of Wawulicze.
